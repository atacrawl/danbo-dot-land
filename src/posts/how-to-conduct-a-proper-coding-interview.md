An ineffective coding interview process increases the likelihood that the right developer will be inadvertently weeded out. The most important step toward creating an effective process, then, is to determine the conditions that could cause the better candidate to underperform and either eliminate those conditions or mitigate their effects.

~~There is a tremendous power imbalance between interviewers and candidates. It is imperative that those doing the hiring do all they can to mitigate the effects of that imbalance. alleviate the anxiety that's unique to interviewing and can inhibit a candidate's best efforts. A confident developer is an effective developer.~~

~~It's important to note that this doesn't mean to make the test too easy! The difficulty level of the coding challenge should match the expected level of the candidate. No process in the world will make capable an incapable candidate.~~

## Make the exercise relevant to the job

This should be obvious, but far too many hiring managers subject their candidates to challenges that have nothing to do with the job they're hiring for. If you're hiring someone to work on a dashboard for analytics software, for example, does it make the most sense to ask a candidate to write a tic-tac-toe game from scratch?

Don't overthink this – if you're hiring for someone to work on a dashboard, make the challenge something related to building a dashboard. No obtuse math concepts, no irrelevant brain teasers. To go along with that, the environment and tech should match with the reality of the position as much as possible as well.

## Set expectations

Another major issue with coding interviews that I've experienced is the unnecessary element of surprise. This is an interview for a job, not a pop quiz!

Give a reasonably thorough explanation of the frameworks, plugins and/or concepts of which a candidate will be expected to demonstrate competence. Avoid being overly broad – telling a candidate they'll be tested on "JavaScript" isn't helpful. Let them know how much time they'll have, and any other pertinent logistical information.

Here is an example of what this could look like:

> Hello Candidate! For the coding interview on Thursday, you will add three functionality enhancements to a Vue-based dashboard interface that uses Vuex for state management. You will have **90 minutes.** HTML/CSS will be provided, though you will be expected to add to it. We use ESLint (Airbnb config), npm and webpack. We will use a Git repo where you will push your changes. I'll give you the rest of the instructions when you're here!

Now your candidate knows what to expect, but without knowing what the test will be. This also signals to the candidate that you've got your ducks in a row and that you're taking this (and them) seriously!

## Don't watch them

If we accept the premise that alleviating anxiety is important to getting more valid results, then under no circumstances should you actively watch the candidate write their code.

Unless your company engages in extensive pair programming (which your candidates should know prior to any coding interviews), your managers or coworkers aren't going to watch you write code. The interview should be no exception. Being watched can make a candidates feel like they can't make a mistake or use a search engine, and there's no way you're getting your candidate's best effort under those kinds of circumstances.

The best way to fix this is simple, just leave the room. If the interview is remote, turn the camera off and mute the mic until the challenge is over. Regardless of venue, remain available to the candidate if they have a question _and mean it_ – strongly emphasize that it is perfectly okay to ask for clarification or help.

## Right-size the exercise

Another easy mistake to make as a hiring manager is to devise a challenge that can't be completed – either the test is too difficult or complicated, or the allotted time is unrealistic. "We want to see how far you get" is the last thing a candidate should hear.

Prioritization is a must-have skill in any developer, but this scenario introduces the wrong kind of prioritization – "what to address first" is replaced with "what to address at all." Maybe the skills you most want to see demonstrated aren't the ones the candidate chooses to tackle. When the work can't be completed, it is much more difficult to compare candidates.

There's no point in giving them part of a test that they can't address.

An effective method for 

There is also the option of dividing the time you give a candidate between many smaller exercises (e.g. three 30-minute tests instead of one 90-minute test) to evaluate on a more granular level. Just make sure you've followed the same process for each test.

## Do a dry-run

If applicable, have your own developers take the test. If you love their work but can't pass your test, you might need to alter it.

It is critically important to have a solid backup plan should something technical go awry, especially if the coding interview is remote. Forcing a candidate to do something like code blind without console access because you didn't have a backup plan is terribly unfair to the candidate and hurts the goal of finding the right developer. _(Yes, this actually happened to me as a candidate.)_

## Take-home? Hmm...

For many positions, a one-, two- or even three-hour test might not cover enough in terms of depth or breadth to vet a candidate, so take-home 


- Time it by two thirds (if an applicant should be able to finish the exercise in 30 minutes, give them 45 minutes)
- Junior developers should get shorter, easier tests
- Enforcing time limits help define scope
- Take-home should be avoided because you can't know how long it actually took someone to complete it
- Practice your own tests!
